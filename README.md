TAWNY
</p></h1>

## General info
Tawny is my end of study project (6months) , this project will be available on github soon ...


## Problematic
It can be really disappointing when someone waits a very long time for an item to arrive and when it
does arrive the package is damaged.
Customers always expect their items to look brand new with no dents, rips or holes.
Poor delivery quality can often result in the item being damaged as nobody wants to take care of it.
Even retailer are not able to see what happens when a package leaves the warehouse.
The most popular issue has consistently been irresponsible driver behavior, meaning many people are
concerned that delivery drivers are the reason behind their damaged parcels.
Parcel damage has increased in recent years, although slightly improved in 2021 compared to last year.
It is important to ensure damage is minimized as this can result in a negative delivery experience for
the customer.
Calling them dissatised customers is an understatement, as 11% said they struggled with customer
service during the delivery process, 15% said they missed work while waiting for a delivery, and 13%
said of keeping an item because of an overly complicated report and return process.
With no evidence to blame anyone, especially the drivers, they will, as always, get away with it.
More like letting the fate of the packages and the company reputation at the mercy of the drivers.
Frankly speaking , if the driver doesn't feel like it, is having a bad day, or even has some personal task
to do after work so he needs to get the job done as soon as possible, the packages get destroyed...
Also, some packages suddenly disappear without a trace or any sign of existence.
Added to this are the costs for the excessive use of the work vehicle for private purposes at the expense
of the company.
Review provider StellaService reported that 1 in 10 e-commerce packages arrived damaged. And it
turns out that some of the largest and oldest carriers are the ones with high damage rates.
UPS delivered the highest percentage of damaged packages at 11 percent, followed by Aramex at 10
percent and FedEx at seven percent.

The key issues that all these businesses have in common are insucient driver,parcels and vehicle
visibility, which leads to a poor understanding of the state of the shipments and contributes to their
high damage rate.
Another issue that the clients found to be particularly frustrating is that the "tracking" application that
they provide only displays the names of the stations or, occasionally, the countries, without providing
any more data like location or real-time data on a map.
The majority of the time, there is nothing that can be done in the case of a problem, such as receiving
a damaged package or one that completely disappears, as each company has a weak and nearly
nonexistent customer support department, and they are unable to take any action, which is to be
expected given that they have no knowledge of the delivery process and no data.
To make the matter even worse , as a result of the poor visibility the drivers also uses the work vehicle
in unauthorized and personal activities at the cost of the company.

## WHAT CAN TAWNY DO?
Tawny  is a standalone project which any company can use,which consists of :
- A device installed in every car that gathers and stores all the necessary information, including
real-time vehicle data including speed, vibration, door openings, geolocation,the list of packages
currently inside the vehicle,a full car diagnostic data like the fuel level, the engine load,the
oxygen sensors data , the board gauges ,the car's faulty messages and the coolant temperature,
and uploads it to the cloud in real-time.
- A web application dedicated to the company which displays real-time data on a large screens in
the control room.
- Another web application also dedicated to the company contains all the stored data where all
the reports submitted by the users can be found and processed either by checking the reports
and any abnormalities linked to delivery or by chatting with the customer directly.
- A mobile application that gives the user the ability to track the package in real time, report
damaged packages and facilitate communication between them and customer service.
